# the following configures the SSLContext with the most appropriate TLS version
# As of April 2015, this is TLSv1.2.  In Java7, the general protocol alias 'TLS'
# points to TLSv1.0, but breaks client-initiated renegotiation and doesn't support
# servers that only support TLSv1.1 or higher. 
# For this patch release (1.3.1), we are keeping the default version at 'TLS', 
# but in future releases (1.4.x, 2.0) the default will change.
# If your runtime is Java 6, set this property value to "TLS", otherwise it is
# safe (and probably preferred for Java7) to set to TLSv1.2.  If you are using
# Java8,  TLS will actually use TLSv1.2, so you can use 'TLS'.
